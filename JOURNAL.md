### ✅ What I Did
- Finalized the project idea for **FlyIt Rig V1** — a DIY flight controller for MSFS 2025
- Wrote and submitted my **project proposal** on Hack Club’s Pitstop
- Planned the **project structure** (yoke → throttle → control panel → brake system)
- Estimated a **$150 BOM** and listed all hardware components needed
- Found YouTube videos as **inspiration/research** for the throttle and brake mechanics
- Wrote a full, clean `README.md` for my GitHub repo

### ⏱️ Time Spent
~3 hours

### 📚 What I Learned / Struggled With
- Learned how to break down a massive idea into modular, manageable parts
- Researched part compatibility — especially bearings, rods, and potentiometers
- Felt a little overwhelmed at first, but breaking it into phases helped a lot
- Struggled to find some exact hardware sources that accept Hack Club card — might need help or workarounds for that later

---

### 🚀 Next Up:
- Begin CAD for the **yoke mechanism**
- Start sourcing/ordering parts from vendors (or ask Hack Club for support)
- Prep second journal entry after progress on CAD or prototyping
