# 🛠️ JOURNAL.md

## 🗓️ May 20, 2025 (started)

### ✅ What I Did
- Finalized the project idea for **FlyIt Rig V1** — a DIY flight controller for MSFS 2025
- Wrote and submitted my **project proposal** on Hack Club’s Pitstop
- Planned the **project structure** (yoke → throttle → control panel → brake system)
- Estimated a **$150 BOM** and listed all hardware components needed
- Found YouTube videos as **inspiration/research** for the throttle and brake mechanics
- Wrote a full, clean `README.md` for my GitHub repo

### ⏱️ Time Spent
~3 hours

### 📚 What I Learned / Struggled With
- Learned how to break down a massive idea into modular, manageable parts
- Researched part compatibility — especially bearings, rods, and potentiometers
- Felt a little overwhelmed at first, but breaking it into phases helped a lot
- Struggled to find some exact hardware sources that accept Hack Club card — might need help or workarounds for that later

---

### 🚀 Next Up:
- Begin CAD for the **yoke mechanism**
- Start sourcing/ordering parts from vendors (or ask Hack Club for support)
- Prep second journal entry after progress on CAD or prototyping

## 🗓️ May 20, 2025 (Entry #2 - Yoke Design Phase)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd86d890-a9fb-4c68-875b-2a3246a915bf)


### ✅ What I Did
- Starte working on the **Yoke mechanism CAD design**
- Took inspiration from existing YouTube builds, but began my **own design from scratch** using Fusion 360
- Figured out how the **shaft and bearings** will align inside the casing
- Identifie that a **solid mounting system** is going to be critical (and maybe tricky) for smooth movement

### ⏱️ Time Spent
~ 4 hours

### 📚 What I Learned / Struggled With
- Learned how to model support brackets and fit the 8mm steel rods properly
- Realized 3D printed parts need extra spacing/tolerances to avoid binding
- Still unsure about the **best place to mount potentiometers** for max accuracy — will need to test with physical parts

---

### 🔜 Next Up
- Finish detailed yoke model (there are still lots of things :( )

## 🗓️ May 29, 2025 (Entry #3 - Yoke Design Phase)
yeah ik its after a long time i was having exams :c

### ✅ What I Did
- Did more working on the **Yoke mechanism CAD design**
- figured how can i attach yoke to bearings and make it move. 

### ⏱️ Time Spent
~ 4.5 hours 

### 📚 What I Learned / Struggled With
- It was very difficult :( learnd legit a lot of things about mechanical parts and tried to attach them to each other.
- struggle alot with it and thats what i learned 

---

### 🔜 Next Up
- have to make a enclosure where i can fit that shaft 
- more work on Yoke mechanism left.

## 🗓️ June 5 2025 (Entery #4 Yoke design done :) 
It was again after a very very long time sorry i was again occupied with papers and stuff and locked in in building!

### ✅ What I Did
- completed the Yoke mechanism finally and also update the `Yoke` folder in guthub 
- assembled all the things together in fusion.

### ⏱️ Time Spent
~15 hours it was like during the two weeks i cant update my journal in beween. 

### 📚 What I Learned / Struggled With
- I used few pre built models for the parts i can find as per my requirement.
- Assembling all the things together got me it was terrible have to change all the designs again and again to adjust.
- I am pretty good now in 3D modelling

---

### 🚀 Next Up:
- Begin CAD for the **Controller** like cessna 
- hace to make a rough sketch first.

## 🗓️ June 11 2025 (Entery #5 startede :) 
Finally onto the next stage :
Base of controller :

Leverr:

### ✅ What I Did
- Started the Controller Mechanism CAD and made the `Controller` folder in repo
- completed almost all the parts except for 

### ⏱️ Time Spent
~ 9 hours it was like during few days. 

### 📚 What I Learned / Struggled With
- Struggle with first designing the main part hw many lever should be there how could the levers work and things
- It was smth actually difficult to make mechanism for ez for CAD lol. (I almost crash out) 
- Finally added 3 levers like cessna 


---

### 🚀 Next Up:
- have to complete controller design and also assemble them together 😭😭
