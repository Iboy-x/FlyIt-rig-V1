## 🗓️ May 20, 2025

### ✅ What I Did
- Finalized the project idea for **FlyIt Rig V1** — a DIY flight controller for MSFS 2025
- Wrote and submitted my **project proposal** on Hack Club’s Pitstop
- Planned the **project structure** (yoke → throttle → control panel → brake system)
- Estimated a **$150 BOM** and listed all hardware components needed
- Found YouTube videos as **inspiration/research** for the throttle and brake mechanics
- Wrote a full, clean `README.md` for my GitHub repo

### ⏱️ Time Spent
~3 hours

### 📚 What I Learned / Struggled With
- Learned how to break down a massive idea into modular, manageable parts
- Researched part compatibility — especially bearings, rods, and potentiometers
- Felt a little overwhelmed at first, but breaking it into phases helped a lot
- Struggled to find some exact hardware sources that accept Hack Club card — might need help or workarounds for that later

---

### 🚀 Next Up:
- Begin CAD for the **yoke mechanism**
- Start sourcing/ordering parts from vendors (or ask Hack Club for support)
- Prep second journal entry after progress on CAD or prototyping

## 🗓️ May 20, 2025 (Entry #2 - Yoke Design Phase)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd86d890-a9fb-4c68-875b-2a3246a915bf)


### ✅ What I Did
- Starte working on the **Yoke mechanism CAD design**
- Took inspiration from existing YouTube builds, but began my **own design from scratch** using Fusion 360
- Figured out how the **shaft and bearings** will align inside the casing
- Identifie that a **solid mounting system** is going to be critical (and maybe tricky) for smooth movement

### ⏱️ Time Spent
~ 4 hours

### 📚 What I Learned / Struggled With
- Learned how to model support brackets and fit the 8mm steel rods properly
- Realized 3D printed parts need extra spacing/tolerances to avoid binding
- Still unsure about the **best place to mount potentiometers** for max accuracy — will need to test with physical parts

---

### 🔜 Next Up
- Finish detailed yoke model (there are still lots of things :( )
