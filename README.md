# 🛫 FlyIt Rig V1
![FlyIt Logo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac3ac454-0e68-446e-ac88-9f14c3ee13fb)



**FlyIt Rig V1** is a DIY, USB-compatible flight yoke + throttle + pedal brake system made for **Microsoft Flight Simulator 2025**. The goal is to build a complete, realistic flight control rig — using affordable parts, Arduino, custom 3D prints, and pure ✨ sweat + logic ✨.

## 🎯 Project Goal

> Build a budget-friendly, USB-compatible flight controller that works with MSFS 2025 — including:
- A smooth, precise **flight yoke**
- Functional **throttle quadrant**
- Responsive **pedal brake system**
- Custom **control panel** with switches/buttons

I found lots of amazing YouTube builds — but only for individual components. My mission? **Combine them all into one fully working beast.**

---

## 🧠 Why It’s Advanced

- Heavy use of **CAD** & **3D printing** for mechanical parts
- Precision design — bearings, rods, and mounts need to be aligned just right
- **Arduino HID programming** to make it work as a real USB joystick
- Reverse engineering to get it working seamlessly with **Microsoft Flight Simulator**
- Tons of debugging, prototyping, and integration

This ain't your average DIY — it’s serious hacker engineering 😤

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- 🧠 **Arduino Micro** (native USB HID support)
- 💻 Microsoft Flight Simulator 2025
- 🧰 Fusion 360 (CAD + 3D printing)
- 🛞 Bearings, steel rods, potentiometers
- 🧼 Custom control box with buttons/switches

---

## 🗂️ Build Plan

I’ll be building in stages — one module at a time:

1. **Flight Yoke** (axis + spring + centering system)
2. **Throttle Quadrant** (with friction + detents)
3. **Control Panel** (switches, buttons, and toggle controls)
4. **Brake Pedals** (paddle-style system)

Every step will be logged in `JOURNAL.md` for transparency and learning.

More design references and files will be added as I build & iterate.

## 🚧 Current Status

> ✅ Proposal submitted on Pitstop  
> 🚧 Hardware sourcing ongoing  
> 🔜 CAD design for yoke and controller done
> 🔜 First prototype in progress
